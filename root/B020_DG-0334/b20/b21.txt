In data source connections between a client and server there are two general types: ODBC which uses a DRIVER and OLEDB which uses a PROVIDER. And in the programming world, it is a regular debate as to which route to go in connecting to data sources.

You are using a provider, SQLOLEDB, but specifying it as a driver. As far as I know, neither the pyodbc nor pypyodbc modules support Window OLEDB connections. However, the adodbapi does which uses the Microsoft ADO as an underlying component.

Below are both approaches for your connection parameters. Also, I string format your variables as your concatenation did not properly break quotes within string. You'll notice I double the curly braces since it is needed in connection string and string.format() also uses it.In data source connections between a client and server there are two general types: ODBC which uses a DRIVER and OLEDB which uses a PROVIDER.
